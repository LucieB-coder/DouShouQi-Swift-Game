# DouShouQi-SwiftGame

This project is a DouShouQi command line game coded in swift and usable in your terminal.

To launch the project, open the `xcworkspace` file in XCode and run the project `DouShouQi_CLI`.

## Commit for correction

To evaluate my work, you can base yourself on the last commit of the branch `tp6`


## Project and Packages

Project `DouShouQi_CLI` : The command line interface of the game

Package `Model`: Model of the application, containing structures, enumerations and tests

Package `ModelEmojiDisplayer`: Model extensions to improve the display of the board in CLI 


## Launch the project and the test

To be able to launch the project, you have to clone this repo and open it in XCode.

If you want to **play a game**, you have to build the Model, then the EmojiDisplayer and finally select and start the project`DouShouQi_CLI`.

You will be able to create the players of the game between two kinds of Player, humanPlayer (you will manually type your moves) and randomPlayer (bot that is playing a random valid move) on a simplified board (the real board will come soon I hope).

If you want to **launch the unit and performance tests**, select the package `Model` and in the Scheme menu, edit the scheme to `Test` and run `Model`.
